# TPP-County-Automator
Automates the creation of county presets/county advanced options in The Political Process. Simply paste your county data into the attached CSV and run the script. You can even use your pre-existing advanced options if you've already got some great ones set up!

### Limitations
There aren't very many limitations, but there are some;
- It's recommended to round your county data to the nearest thousandth place, since exact division in any coding language is impossible (if you're confused, go to this [StackOverflow page.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/588004/is-floating-point-math-broken))
- Windows is necessary for this script, as that's what TPP uses and other operating systems probably won't work.
